Stealing
No stealing unless both parties are [LINK]pa system|LINK|aggressive[/LINK] or the items in question have lore tags (except g-coin), have impossible enchantments, or are dropped heads from someone who’s just died. 
Items in shops or trades cannot be stolen. 
Items destroyed, eaten, or consumed by their rightful owner do not require replacement. However, if a player is AFK or at an end farm, any lost items must be replaced.
Services in spawn zones (like shops or museums) are able to enforce entrance fees or conditions.

Trading with other people's villagers or using their farms also counts as stealing!

Griefing
You may not grief someone's build. Any modifications must be fixed within a timely manner.  
However, pranks are allowed, given you fix it if asked. 

Dynmaps can show the locations of people’s bases. The base rings cannot be built inside of.

Farms
Don't use other peoples’ farms without permission. 

Killing animals in a farm is considered griefing.

Spawn
Builds at spawn will not own land around them unless marked or clearly decorated.  
Unfinished builds may be given to other players after a long period of inactivity. 

Spawn beacons need a 3x3 hole every 100 blocks; take this into account.

Contracts
Agreements are binding until the conditions are met. To be valid, both parties must acknowledge and screenshot the in-game chat messages. 

If no conditions are given, it expires after one month.
